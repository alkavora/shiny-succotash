		<p>Nothing in world is perennial, even the toughest and strongest of structures also. The prompt suggests that grounds of historic buildings should be used for modern purposes rather than preserving the existing buildings. In my opinion, this is a very extreme statement, and it cannot be held true for all situations and there will be some cases where preservation of historic buildings is unnecessary. This opinion is made more clear by the following three points.

Generally, ancient buildings provide a lot of information about the community of the people it belonged to. It depicts the architecture, art, culture and lifestyle of that time. These things are valuable to the nation as they are it's heritage. These artifacts, once damaged or lost, cannot be re-generated. They should be therefore analysed and maintained very carefully. Consider the example of Mumbai, a city in India, has a lot of ancient buildings constructed by the British rulers during their period. Even though they were designed and built very well, they did show signs of minor wear and tear. These buildings went under preservation and infact they are used currently for the purpose they were made for. This part of the city is often referred to as the classic Mumbai and is a popular attraction for photographers and tourists which helps the state tourism government gain more profits. Had they all been demolished and used for building modern structures,it could be said that the nation would have sacrificed a lot for something that could be built at some other place. Therefore, preserving old buildings is essential from an economic and cultural perspective.

Despite of being of historic, an analysis should be carried out by government about the significance of that building. It is not necessary that every historic building would be definitely something stellar. It might be a very common house or just a basic restaurant! That ground space could be instead utilized to erect modern structures like malls, hotels, orchestras, auditoriums and so on. Modern development is as valuable as historic buildings. If modern design and architecture is not given a chance than we would not have exceptional buildings that we currently have. Think about all the unique places in the world, they are examples of modern development and one day they will too, become historic buildings.

So if the above suggestion would pe held true, that building which is now considered great would be demolished in future for some other modern development. Hence, it should be carefully decided and analysed that which buildings are valueable for the nation and culture, which are examples of iconic design and development and then decision should be made whether to build a new one or preserve the existing.</p>
